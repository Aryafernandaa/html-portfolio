<h1>The Best Movies According to Arya</h1>
<h2>My Top 4 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>
  A perfect movie. The tension, the looks, the story it all combines into one.
  <em>This is Cinema.</em>
</p>
<h3>Nightcrawler</h3>
<p>
  The hustle of the Jake Gyllenhaal character is just absolutely mindblowing,
  and it creates a perfect story (at least for me).
</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
  Forrest Gump is a wonderful person. One scene that I remember is the scene
  where Forrest Gump join the military and was asked by the Drill Sergeant:
  <br />
  "GUuuuUUuUuUmmMPp what's your sole purpose in this army?"
  <br />
  and gump said: <br />
  "To do whatever you tell me Drill Sergeant" <br />
  <em>Definetely worth your time.</em>
</p>
<h3>Dune: Part Two</h3>
<p>
  This movie is an absolute banger. It definitely tops the first movie. But the
  part one is also a really good one, don't get me wrong though.
